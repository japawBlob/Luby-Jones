# Graphviz visualisation

This is folder, where you can visualize graphs generated by graph generator or main program.
In order to represent graphviz .dot files, you need to have graphviz installed and then just
use enclosed ```Makefile```

Please note, that graphviz can have hard time with large files. This is used for checking only 
small datasets.
