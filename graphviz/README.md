# Graphviz visualisation

This is folder, where you can visualize graphs generated by graph generator or main program.
In order to represent graphviz .dot files, you need to have [graphviz](https://graphviz.org/) installed and then just
use the enclosed ```Makefile```

Please note, that graphviz can have hard time with large files. Checking only small ones is recommended.
